# 📍 AIMS 2K28: Scene Localization in Dense Images

This project is a submission for the AIMS 2K28 Recruitment problem statement. It is a robust, interactive system that can identify, segment, and localize specific sub-scenes within a dense image based on a natural language query. The final prototype exceeds the initial requirements by implementing a state-of-the-art GroundedSAM pipeline and several custom modules for advanced semantic refinement and quality control.

## ✨ Core Features

- 📌 **State-of-the-Art GroundedSAM Pipeline**: Produces precise, background-removed segmentation masks instead of simple bounding boxes for superior accuracy and cleaner visualizations.
- 🔓 **Open-Vocabulary Detection**: Localizes any object, attribute, or action described by free-form text, not just pre-defined classes.
- 🧠 **Advanced Semantic Refinement**: Incorporates a suite of custom modules for intelligent filtering and ranking:
    - 🥇 **Top-3 Ranked Results**: Acknowledges ambiguity in dense scenes by providing the top three best-matching candidates.
    - 🚫 **Negative Prompting (Contrastive Filtering)**: Allows the user to provide negative queries (e.g., "white shirt") to actively disqualify irrelevant results, significantly improving search precision.
    - 🛡️ **Multi-Stage Quality Gating**: Employs a series of confidence and heuristic checks to filter out low-quality or nonsensical "hallucinated" results.
- 📦 **Self-Contained & Reproducible**: Includes all necessary model weights via Git LFS, allowing for a seamless "clone-and-run" setup experience as requested.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Web UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Gradio for easy demonstration and testing, complete with status feedback for a professional user experience.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The system is built on a state-of-the-art **GroundedSAM** pipeline, which intelligently combines three powerful pre-trained models in a multi-stage process. The architecture is heavily influenced by the principle of **contrastive learning**, applying it at inference time to refine results.

1. 🐤 **Candidate Proposal (GroundingDINO):** The input image and text prompt are fed into a **GroundingDINO** model to identify potential bounding boxes. A Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) step with an IoU threshold of 0.7 is applied to remove redundant, highly overlapping boxes.

2. 🔍 **Semantic Disqualification (CLIP):** If a negative prompt is provided, this custom filter is activated. This module is a practical, inference-time application of the same principle behind training techniques like **Triplet Loss**. For each candidate, its semantic similarity to both the positive and negative prompts is calculated using **CLIP**. A candidate is **completely disqualified** if it matches the negative prompt more strongly than the positive one.

3. ⚖️ **Heuristic Re-ranking (DINO + CLIP):** All surviving candidates are ranked based on a `combined_score` (`0.4 * dino_confidence + 0.6 * clip_score`), balancing raw detection confidence with nuanced semantic understanding.

4. 🛟 **Quality Gating & Final Selection:** The system iterates through the ranked list and applies two final gatekeeper filters:
    - ✅ **Confidence Gate:** A result is only accepted if its `combined_score` is above a minimum threshold (`0.25`) OR its raw `dino_confidence` is exceptionally high (`0.90`). This dual-condition check prevents low-quality guesses while preserving obvious, high-confidence detections.
    - 🧩 **Mask Density Gate:** The candidate box is passed to SAM. If the resulting mask is too sparse (less than 5% of its bounding box area), it is discarded as "pixel dust."
    
    The system collects the **first three candidates** that successfully pass all filters.

5. ✂️ **Precise Segmentation (SAM):** For the final, validated candidates, the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** is used to generate pixel-perfect, background-removed segmentation masks.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

This repository uses Git LFS to manage large model weights.

**1. Install Git LFS:**
Before cloning, ensure you have Git LFS installed. You can download it from [git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com).
```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install git-lfs
```

**2. Clone the repository:**
When you clone the repository, Git LFS will automatically download the large model weight files, ensuring all necessary components are present.
```bash
git clone [Your Git Repo URL]
cd [Your Repo Name]
```
*(Note: If the weights do not download automatically, run `git lfs pull` inside the repository.)*

**3. Create and activate a conda environment:**
A Python 3.10 environment is recommended.
```bash
conda create --name scene_loc python=3.10
conda activate scene_loc
```

**4. Install dependencies:**
All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧭 Development Journey: Blockers and Solutions

This project involved an iterative development process where several challenges were identified and overcome through systematic tuning and architectural improvements.

- 🔮 **Blocker: Model "Hallucinations" on Non-Existent Objects.**
    - 🧩 **Problem:** Initial versions of the pipeline would find low-confidence, nonsensical matches for queries like "a purple elephant" instead of returning nothing.
    - 🛠️ **Solution:** A **Confidence Gate** was implemented. This dual-threshold check (`MIN_FINAL_SCORE` and `HIGH_DINO_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`) acts as a quality filter, rejecting results that are not sufficiently confident and ensuring the system fails gracefully.

- 🧼 **Blocker: Imprecise or "Junk" Segmentations.**
    - 🧾 **Problem:** When SAM was given a vague bounding box, it sometimes produced fragmented, "pixel dust" masks that were not useful.
    - ✅ **Solution:** A **Mask Density Filter** was added. This custom module calculates the ratio of object pixels to the total bounding box area and discards any mask that is too sparse, ensuring only solid, object-like segmentations are shown.

- ⚖️ **Blocker: Ambiguous Results and Poor Precision.**
    - 🔍 **Problem:** The model struggled to differentiate between visually similar concepts, such as a "light blue shirt" versus a "white shirt" in tricky lighting.
    - 🚫 **Solution:** The **Negative Prompting** feature was designed and implemented. Initial attempts using score manipulation (subtraction/multiplication) proved unstable. The final, robust solution was a **disqualification filter**, which completely removes a candidate if it matches the negative query more strongly than the positive one. This provides a powerful and intuitive way for the user to refine search results.

- 🔁 **Blocker: Redundant Detections.**
    - ⚠️ **Problem:** The model would sometimes detect the same object multiple times with slightly different bounding boxes.
    - 🎯 **Solution:** The **NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) threshold** was tuned from a permissive `0.8` to a more aggressive `0.7`, effectively merging these duplicate detections and ensuring the Top-3 results are visually distinct.

## 🚀 Future Aspects & Unimplemented Ideas

While the current prototype is robust and feature-rich, the following advanced phases were planned and explored but not implemented due to the project's timeframe.

- 📊 **Quantitative Evaluation (mAP):** The logical next step is to establish a rigorous, quantitative benchmark for the system. This would involve creating a manually-labeled ground-truth test set and implementing an evaluation script to calculate the **Mean Average Precision (mAP)** score. This would allow for objective measurement of any future model improvements.

- ⚙️ **Model Fine-Tuning (Triplet Loss):** To address the model's core limitations in differentiating nuanced concepts (like colors), a full fine-tuning phase was planned. This would involve using the massive **Visual Genome** dataset to re-train the final layers of the CLIP vision encoder. The training would leverage a **Triplet Loss** function to explicitly teach the model a better semantic understanding of similarity and difference. This advanced step requires significant cloud compute resources (GPU/TPU) and a dedicated data processing pipeline.
